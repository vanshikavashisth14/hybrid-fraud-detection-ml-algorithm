Abstract
FraudFusion++ is a machine learning-based fraud detection framework designed for digital payment systems. The framework combines unsupervised anomaly detection using Isolation Forest, supervised fraud classification using CatBoost, and an Adaptive Risk Decision Engine (ARDE) for intelligent transaction risk assessment.

Research Problem
Existing studies have explored fraud classification, anomaly detection, hybrid learning, and risk management, but these capabilities are often considered separately. Simply predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent may not be enough in a practical payment system, where it is also important to identify unusual behaviour, assess transaction risk, and determine an appropriate action. FraudFusion++ addresses this gap by combining Isolation Forest, CatBoost, and an Adaptive Risk Decision Engine (ARDE) to provide risk-based decision support beyond simple fraud prediction.

Proposed Framework
FraudFusion++ consists of three major components:

Isolation Forest
Detects unusual transaction behaviour
Identifies anomalous transactions
Generates normalized anomaly scores
CatBoost Classifier
Learns fraud patterns from labelled transactions
Uses transaction features along with anomaly-related information
Classifies transactions as fraud or genuine
Adaptive Risk Decision Engine (ARDE)
Combines fraud probability and anomaly score with transaction risk factors
Considers transaction amount and timing during risk assessment
Determines the overall risk level and recommended action
Dataset
The research uses a synthetic digital payment transaction dataset created for experimental evaluation. The dataset simulates transaction behaviour for fraud detection research and does not contain real customer or financial information.

Results
The proposed FraudFusion++ framework achieved an accuracy of 96.93%.

Research Contribution
Combines Isolation Forest for anomaly detection and CatBoost for fraud classification.
Uses ARDE to combine fraud probability, anomaly score, transaction amount, and timing for risk assessment.
Extends fraud detection from simple fraud/genuine prediction to risk-based decision support with recommended actions.
Limitations
The framework is evaluated using a synthetic dataset.
Periodic threshold tuning may be required for the risk decision mechanism.
Combining multiple detection techniques introduces slightly higher computational complexity.
Performance may vary when applied to real-world transaction data.
Future Work
Evaluation using larger real-world datasets
Continuous monitoring of model performance
Automated threshold adaptation
